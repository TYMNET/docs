README.DAT - April 30, 1987        Notes for Version 4.00

Included are the programs LINEMON.EXE, CALLMON.EXE, and AI.EXE.      
These are test programs created for our own use during develop-
ment. Users should be warned that these come as a unsupported
freebies. Of course we would like to know about bugs even if
these are not part of the project.  

Using The Driver:

The -B command line parameter allows you to adjust the size of the
internal data buffer.  We have tested with the following sizes:
1 Virtual circuit   Min. 2750  Rec. 3500
6 Virtual circuits  Min. 7500  Rec. 10000
15 Virtual circuits Min. 22500 Rec. 30000
The default is -b6000 which is ok for 3-4 virtual circuits.  These
are only guidelines.  A well behaved application that is reading
all the channels can operate with far less than the size
recommended.  On the other hand, an application that is not doing a
good job of reading from the driver may never have enough memory.

The -U parameter unloads the driver.  Terminate and stay resident
programs must be unloaded in the opposite order from loading.  To
do this we recommend using a batch file.  For example the following
batch file is used with the IMM1 application:

XPC.EXE -b3000
IMM1.EXE
XPC.EXE -U

The -X parameter specifies the interrupt vector used by the driver.
Note that the application must also be capable of referencing a
different vector.  If you specify a different vector when loading,
you must also specify it when unloading.

The -T parameter causes the driver to chain on the timer interrupt
vector at load time rather than when the device is reset as
documented.  Applications which change the 0x8 hardware timer
interrupt after the X.PC device reset should use this flag.
(For example, Smartym 3270)

The -C parameter causes the driver to ignore CTS.

Any other illegal parameter will cause a help/useage message to be
displayed.

Below is a rough memory map of the driver:

Code   30000
Static  6000
Stack   2000
Timers  3000
Comm Buf 500
-B buf  6000  This can be changed with the -b parameter.

To compile and link the code:

1) If you have not installed Microsoft C 4.0 and the Microsoft
Macro Assembler, do so at this time.

The directions for installing your Microsoft C 4.0 on the hard disk
are given on page 22 of the Microsoft C User's Guide.  Follow them
with one modification: wherever it specifies \BIN, \INCLUDE, or
\LIB, use \MSC\BIN, \MSC\INCLUDE, and \MSC\LIB, respectively,
instead.  This way, these three directories do not clutter up the
root directory of your hard disk.  If you have already installed
the compiler, you will have to modify the autoexec.bat below.

To install the Microsoft Macro Assembler 4.0, simply make a \MASM
directory on your hard disk, and copy the assembler disk to it
completely.

2) Modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT

SET INCLUDE=\XPC\HDR;\MSC\INCLUDE
SET LIB=\MSC\LIB
PATH \MSC\BIN;\MASM
SET TMP=\

If you have entries already for the PATH, place them AFTER the
entry for \MSC\BIN.  If you have installed your Microsoft C 4.0 in
other directories, use the appropriate directory names.  

Use the version of the linker that comes with the 4.0 compiler. 
The one that comes with the assembler does not work correctly.

Then execute the following batch files:

C> CMPXPC.BAT     /* This will compile the X.PC driver */
C> CMPUTL.BAT     /* This will compile the utilities */
C> LNKXPC.BAT     /* This will link the X.PC driver */
C> LNKUTL.BAT     /* This will link the utilities */

(Note that MAN.EXE is supplied, and not compiled or linked with the
scripts.)

Read the .BAT files for more detail.

A Lint script (LINTXPC.BAT) is also on the \XPC directory.  Of
course Gimpel's PC Lint must be properly installed in the path
command of the autoexec.bat for this to work.
