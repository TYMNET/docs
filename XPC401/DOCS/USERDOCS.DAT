USERDOCS.DAT - April 28, 1987

Notes for programmers using the X.PC 4.00+ Driver.

* References to the "Old" driver, are to versions before 4.00.

* Report I/O Status - This function is the heart and soul of the
driver. It should be called frequently whenever connected to
anything. It MUST be called just prior to any call to Output Data
or Input Data. When no Input or Output Data calls are being
performed, and no data is expected from the other side, it is ok to
miss some time, but you should try to call it every couple of
seconds.

* Output Data - Be sure to get the I/O status first, and don't call
this function if the output status is 2. This function, if passed
less than 128 characters, will almost always send everything. Do
not depend on this. Always check the amount actually transferred.
The later versions of the driver allow more than 128 bytes to be
Output at one time. It is recommended that the user refrain from
doing this. If, however, the application does decide to take
advantage of this, then you MUST check the number of bytes output,
as it is possible that less was sent than expected. There is also
a potential of getting a flow control error in this case. If the
driver reports 0 bytes sent, try reading data from the driver
before repeating the send. The driver may have run out of buffer
space for the send.

* It is a good idea to read all the data available in the driver
before outputing data. This frees up buffer space in the driver.
It is essential that you do this if you are running multiple
channels with local echo.

* Read Channel Status - This does not have to be called as often,
as long as Report I/O Status is being called. During call setup
and clearing, however, this function should be called regularly.
It should also be called every second or so to make sure that the
channel state hasn't changed unexpectedly.

Note the new Reset Received or Sent state in the Driver Interface
Specification. After you read this state, the state will return to
whatever it was before the reset occurred. Processing of this
state is up to you, and does not necessarily require a Session
Clear or the like, but be warned:  This state usually is
accompanied by some loss of data across the link. This loss is
unavoidable, due to the nature of the problem which caused the
reset. A reset generally occurs if enough packets are rejected in
a row without any valid packets being received in between. It
generally means that something is wrong with the physical link,
usually in the form of too much noise.

Channel states sometimes don't go the way you might predict, due to
errors or lack of resources. Whenever you check channel status,
always include code which would cover all of the different states.
(The most common mistake is to assume that a state must have
changed because a function which changes it has been called. See
notes on other functions below.)

The old driver sometimes crashed on a call to read status of
channel zero. With the new driver, channel zero should be checked
every once in a while to see if something odd has happened. (It
also sets it back to Connected state.)  No action is required on
these problems, but it is likely that the user will wish to do
something about it. Most of the problems which might show up on
channel zero would have cleared your sessions, anyway.

Call clearing codes have changed due to conflicts between the PAD
specification and the Driver Interface spec. (And the XNS, for
that matter.)  Make sure you have the correct ones.

* Clear Device - This should be called as a prelude to the very
first connection. It probably should be called between each
additional connection. It can never hurt to call this whenever
disconnected. It should also be called before your program exits.
When called, the port parameters are reset to their default values.

* Read Device Status - Most of the entries are constant and can be
ignored for now. While the docs list several "default" values,
make no assumptions that these are the values in there. It is
possible (even likely) that these values have been modified by
earlier calls to the driver.

* Device Reset - Only the port address is taken from the passed
DSS. The device state changes as specified in the function.
Everything else is constant. This function should be called just
before you try to make your connection, with a non-zero port.

Changing interrupt vectors (either the 0x8 timer, or the comm
vector corresponding to the port address) while the port is active
is likely to cause problems. If necessary, be certain to chain the
interrupt properly. The new driver does this with the 0x8 timer.
(The old driver does so too, but with the 0x1C timer instead.)

Also be warned that the reverse is true as well... If your program
is using either of these vectors and does not want the driver to
modify them, be aware that Device Reset sets both interrupts as
well as the 8250 and 8259. With the comm port this is usually not
fatal. With the timer, problems could cause the program to hang.
If you wish to use the 0x8 timer without having to worry about X.PC
modifying it, then use the -T flag whenever loading it. This flag
forces X.PC to take the timer vector at LOAD time, so as long as
you pass the interrupt through to the old vector (an absolute MUST
for anyone using this vector...) there should be no conflict.

When Device Reset has been called with a non zero port, the driver
believes it has total control over that port. Fiddle with it at
your own peril.

Finally, remember to set a zero port before you exit your program
(or call Clear Device). Otherwise, the interrupts are still left
active. Not a good idea.

* Set Character State - When it says "All Packet Channels..." in
the docs, it does not include channel Zero, which cannot be
disconnected in any case. Older versions of the driver may
complain, but work anyway. Or they may not complain and not work.
If you get an error 19 when you set character state and you are
certain you closed all your channels, then you have an old driver
and should update it.

* Set Packet State - The new driver disables XON/XOFF explicitly.
This should not be any problem as it restores it with Set
Character State.

* Set Port Parameters - XON/XOFF defaults to ON, not OFF. The
default baud rate is 1200. (This is not a modification. It was a
misprint in the docs.)

This function is now callable in any state. This is to maintain
compatibility with the old driver. It is, however, advisable to
call this function only in Character or Packet states, when a non-
zero port address has been set.

In character mode, if Report I/O Status reports flow controlled due
to receipt of an XOFF, the only method of clearing this (while
remaining connected) in the old driver is to receive an XON. In
the new driver, it is possible to clear this condition by calling
this function with the XON/XOFF parameter set to 0 (disabled) and
again to set it back to normal. This may not clear the flow
condition instantaneously, but will begin transmission again so
that flow will soon be cleared, unless, of course, the host sends
another XOFF.  By setting XON/XOFF off, the flags preventing
transmission due to XOFFs are cleared, and this allows the rest to
work.

* Read Port Parameters - The parity, data bits, and XON/XOFF status
will report what the user had set them to, even though in packet
mode these are forced to NO parity, 8 data bits, and XON/XOFF off.

* Test DCD - Make good use of this function. It is the best way to
determine if you have lost carrier. Upon loss of carrier in packet
mode it is the application's responsibility to take appropriate
action.

* Send Break - The new driver will not send another break in packet
mode if the outgoing buffers are full. No error is returned. The
old driver allowed the application to overfill the buffers with
breaks and then crashed, so this is actually an improvement.

In character mode, this function sends a physical break of at least
250ms. (The new driver sends for about 330 ms.)  Control remains
with the driver until this is completed.

* The break and error detected flags, when set, remain set until
read, whereupon they are cleared. This is different break handling
than the old driver, which set the break flag when a break began,
and cleared it when the break finished. (In packet mode it was
almost impossible to see a break.)

This function can be called almost at any time (save when in Wait
Reset state) but will return Output flow controlled unless in
character mode, or on a Connected channel.

* Send Session Request - Remember to put the CR at the end of the
string. It is important when logging on to Tymnet. Do not put a
LF at the end. As mentioned above, just because this function has
been called is no reason to assume that you are now in Pending
Session Accept. Allow for ANY state to be there. (Especially
DISCONNECTED.)

* Send Session Clear - Because of the pending clear confirm timer,
the session may still be considered connected by the other side.
It is usually a good idea to send a logoff string to the host
before clearing the session. In fact, it is usually best to send
the logoff string and wait for the host to clear the channel
itself, if possible.

* Session Answer Set - Use Send Session Clear with a short timeout
to stop waiting on this. Again, I that it is important to assume
that just about any channel state could appear here.

* Set Interrupt - Hardware interrupts are almost always disabled
during this routine, so make it fast. Long interrupts could cause
loss of incoming character data. Do NOT call the driver from an
interrupt routine, not even to Reset Interrupt. The driver will
not allow it. (For that matter, If the driver is executing a
function and your application manages to gain control, it cannot
call the driver again until the driver returned from it's function.
There are built in safeguards preventing this.)

The routine called, is an interrupt routine. This means that it
must return with an IRET instruction. It should be careful about çästack usage and all registers used must be restored before you
return.

Timers and Checkpointing reset themselves automatically when done.
Modem Status does not.

* Set PAD Parameters - Default forward timeout is 1/6 second. Most
applications will probably want to set this longer.

* Link Statistics - Redefined and implemented as follows:

Function Name      : Link Statistics
Function Code      : 32
Parameter 1 (i)    : Link Statistics Structure

The device return various link statistics. This is a destructive
read, after which the values are reset to zero. Device reset will
also reset these values. Framing errors, Overrun errors, and
Parity errors are counted at all times, even in packet mode. The
format for the Link Statistics Structure is as follows:

   CRC errors          :   Word
   Framing errors      :   Word
   Overrun errors      :   Word
   Parity errors       :   Word
   Packets sent        :   Word
   Packets received    :   Word

           Display Clear cause code
       else if status is not Pending Clear Confirm
          Send Session Clear **


** The timeout for the session clear generally seems to work best
at around 5 or so seconds. If you want to use values much larger
than that, then you may want to give the user a way to stop waiting
and return immediately. In this case, you could issue a SECOND
session clear with a minimal (1/6th second) timeout and you would
then disconnect quickly. You do not want to return from clear call
until you are in Disconnect state unless it is an emergency. (If
you need to exit and *cannot* wait for Disconnect, issue a Clear
Device, then exit.)
