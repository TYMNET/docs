Version 4.00 is a complete rewrite of the driver, to make
it more readable, maintainable, perform better, to cover more
error situations as well as to add features.  Many problems which
the old driver would have aborted to DOS upon encountering will now
instead return an error to the application.  Since this is a
complete rewrite, there may be slight differences in the driver's
reaction to some events.  We have attempted to match the old driver
as closely as possible.  Specific changes have been made, to
improve the driver or fix known bugs, and are listed below:


1) There are now command line parameters which allow you to specify
various options which could previously only be changed by modifying
the code and recompiling.  See README.DAT for a detailed
description of these parameters.

2) The driver may now be unloaded after use, by specifying a
command line parameter.  See README.DAT.

3) The driver is now an EXE file instead of a COM file.

4) The driver now uses the INT 8 hardware timer interrupt vector
for it's internal timing needs.  If your program changes the 0x8
vector after performing a non-zero device reset (it shouldn't),
then you must specify the -T command line parameter, which
tells the driver to set and reset the INT 8 vector at load and
unload times, rather than at Device Reset time.  See README.DAT and
X.PC Driver User Documentation for more information.  

5) In character mode, it is now possible to cancel a received XOFF
by turning off the xonxoff port parameter and turning it back on
again.  See X.PC Driver User Documentation.  

6) When a break is received (hardware break in character mode, or
break packets in packet mode) the break received bit is set and is
not cleared until a Report I/O Status has been performed.  See
X.PC Driver User Documentation.  

7) The link statistics call in the Driver Interface Specification
has finally been implemented, although the details have changed.
See the X.PC Driver User Documentation for a full description.  

8) Packet retransmission timeouts are somewhat more forgiving than
in previous versions.  There should be fewer retransmissions now
which were caused because of low baud rate or number of open
channels.

9) The driver now safely supports up to 15 sessions open at the
same time.  Note that buffer space requirements for this number of
channels is higher than the default buffer space.  The larger
amount can be specified at load time via a command line parameter.
See README.DAT.

10) The driver, in DCE mode, now properly issues Restart
Confirmation packets with a P(R) of one instead of zero.  This
matches the Protocol and the XNS.  It will still accept a Restart
Confirmation with a P(R) of zero, to be compatible with the old
driver.

11) The driver uses a new set of call clearing codes, which is now
the official set of clearing codes, and overrides the conflicting
sets listed in the Driver Interface Specification and the PAD
Protocol Specification.
