KCI C Programming Language Style Guidelines
-------------------------------------------


Large programs are broken down into smaller modules. Each module
contains one or more related functions, and a limit of
approximately 500 lines of code per module is suggested.

Each module is broken down into several parts:

  Module description - a comment which contains a description of
    the module's contents and purpose. This comment may also
    include a copyright notice and revision information.

  Inclusion of header files

  Local definitions - Any #defines, typedefs, and structure
    definitions used ONLY by functions within this module should
    be placed here, preferrably in that order. Any of these which
    will be used by more than one module should be placed in a
    header file, which is included in all modules needing them.

  External, global, and static variables - In that order. One to
    a line. Each of these should have a short comment explaining
    their use. Grouping may be alphabetical by name, type, or
    both, or by usage, as long as grouping is consistant
    throughout all modules.

  Functions - All functions should be coded according to the
    formatting conventions described in the excerpt from the
    Whitesmiths manual. Each function should have a short
    explanitory comment above it. Order of functions is usually
    based on a top-down approach, although this is not necessarily
    required. A consistent method of ordering is, however,
    essential.


Variable Names

 Variable names should accurately reflect what they do. Names
like "quotient" and "abort_code" are much more meaningful than "q"
or "abt". Abbriviations may be used sparingly, as long as what they
are abbriviating is obvious. On the other hand, variable names
like "last_character_from_input_file" are unnecessarily long and
should be avoided. All variable names should be in lower case
only, with underscores seperating words. Function names follow the
same rules as variable names.


Defines

 #define statements should be used with care. All constants
should be declared with an upper case name, using similar naming
rules as for vaiables. Macros may be lower case when used to
simulate a function, otherwise they should be upper case.

 Some things NOT to use define statements for:  Never use a define
to redefine a C operator (such as NE for "!=" or EQ for "==" or MOD
for "%"). Do not use defines to index partially into an array of
arrays or a structure.


Comments

 Comments on code should be concise and to the point. They are
there to clarify code, and as such should not mimic what the code
says; rather, they should explain what the code actually
accomplishes and/or why it is done.

 Comments may be placed either: 1) directly above the statement(s)
to which they refer, in which case they should be indented to the
same level as the code, or 2) to the right of the statement. In
this case, the comment should be placed at least one tab stop to
the right of the end of the statement, and should not extend the
line beyond 80 characters. (Additional lines may be used, aligning
the text of additional lines with the text of the first line.)  In
addition, some attempt should be made to align all comments which
are on the right side of statements with each other.

 Examples:


      LOCAL TEXT input_char;        /* last character received */
      LOCAL BOOL delay;             /* signal to delay 30 seconds
                                     * before transmitting.
                                     */


      /*
       * If three or more packets have been received,
       * process them
       */
      if (buffers_used > 0)
          process_buffers(buffers_used);


Goto statements:

 While there *is* such a statement in the language, it is best to
behave as if there isn't. If you think you've found a good excuse
to use this statement, examine your code again.


Expressions using ? and :

 If these expressions get too elaborate, it is usually best to
change them to an if-else statement. This usually is more
readable, and generally compiles to identical code.

FORMATTING

While it may seem a trivial matter, the formatting of a C program
can make all the difference between correct comprehension and
repeated error. To get maximum benefit from support tools such as
editors and cross references, one should apply formatting rules
rigorously. The following high-handed dicta have proved their
worth many time over:

Each external declaration should begin (with optional storage class
and mandatory type) at the beginning of a line, immediately
following its explanatory comment. All defining material, data
initializers of function definitions, should be indented at least
one tab stop, plus additional tab stops to reflect substructure. 
Tabs should be set uniformly every four to eight columns.

A function body, for instance, always looks like:

TYPE name(arg1, arg2, arg3)
   TYPE1 arg1;
   TYPE2 arg2, arg3;
   {
   <local declarations>

   <statements>
   }

This example assumes that arg2 and arg3 have the same type. If no
<local declarations> are present, there is no empty line before
<statements>.

<local declarations> consist of first extern (IMPORT), then
register (FAST), then auto (no storage class specifier), then
statis (INTERN) declarations; those are sorted alphabetically by
type within storage class and alphabetically by name within type. 
Comma separated lists may be used, so long as there are no
initializers; an initialized variable should stand alone with its
initializers. FAST and auto storage should be initialized at
declaration time only if the value is not to change.

<statements> are formatted to emphasize control structure,
according to the following basic patterns:

   if (test)
       <statement>

   if (test)
       {
       <statement>
       <statement>
       ...
       }
   else
       <statement>

   if (test1)
       <statement>
   else if (test2)
       <statement>
   else if (test3)
       ...
   else
       <default statement>
   switch (value)
       {
   case A:
   case B:
       <statement>
       ...
       break;
   case C:
       <statement>
       ...
       break;
   default:
       <statement>
       ...
       }

   while (test)
       <statement>

   for (init; test; incr)
       <statement>

   for (; test; incr)
       <statement>

   for (init; ; )
       <statement>

   FOREVER
       <statement>

   return (expr);

Note that, with the explicit exception of the else-if chain, each
subordinate <statement> is intended one tab stop further to the
right than its controlling statement. Without this rule, an else-
if chain would be written:

   if (test 1)
       <statement>
   else
       if (test 2)
           <statement>
       else
           if (test 3)
               <statement>
           ...
               else
                   <default statement>

Within statements, there should be no empty lines, nor any tabs or
multiple spaces imbedded in a line. Each keyword should be
followed by a single space, and each binary operator should have a
single space on each side. No spaces should separate unary or
addressing operators from their operands. A possible exception to
the operator rule is a composite constant, such as (GREEN|BLUE).

Parentheses should be used whenever there is a hint of ambiguity. 
Note in particular that & and | mix poorly with the relational
operators, that the assigning operators are weaker than && and ||,
and that << and >> are impossible to guess right. The worst
offender is

   if ((a & 030) != 030)
       ...

which does entirely the wrong thing is the parentheses are omitted.

If an expression is too long to fit on a line (of no more than 80
characters) it should be continued on the next line, indented one
tab stop further than its start. A good rule is to continue only
inside parentheses, or with a trailing operator on the preceding
line, so that displaced fragments are more certain to cause
diagnostics.


--End of Excerpt--

Some final notes:

 Functions with many levels of indenting (usually five or more) as
well as those larger than 1 or 2 pages of code should probably be
split out into one or more subfunctions. This is a general
guideline, but not a rule.


 It is generally best to surround all C operators by spaces. 
Hence:

          if (x==1)

 is better written:

          if (x == 1)

 Note that parenthesis, being seperators themselves, do not apply.


 A function call should not include a space between the function
name and the parenthesis. This seperates function calls from
keywords followed by parenthesis, where a space should be included.
 Ex:

      funct (p1, p2);          is WRONG
      funct(p1, p2);           is RIGHT

      for(a; b; c)             is WRONG
      for (a; b; c)            is RIGHT
