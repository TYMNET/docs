Asynchronous Communications & Interrupts

DESCRIPTION

At this level, the driver interfaces directly to the IBM PC comm
hardware, sending data from a transmit queue, and receiving data
into a circular buffer. All of this is interrupt driven via the
comm interrupt, and is written in assembler to allow for the
greatest possible speed.

The original X.PC driver made use of this interrupt to do its link
level processing, as well as a good portion of it's packet level
processing. The 4.00 driver uses this interrupt only for it's
minimum necessary processing, which results in higher performance
and less risk of interrupt conflict.


Incoming characters - are placed in a circular buffer of fixed size
as soon as they are received. Should the buffer become full, the
read pointer will "wrap", causing all the data in the buffer to be
lost. In packet mode, the loss of characters is merely an
annoyance, as the packets will be retransmitted anyway. In
character mode, XON/XOFF pacing may be required to avoid loss of
characters, especially at higher baud rates. XON/XOFF pacing (to
the host) is prompted by the character mode Link level when it
detects that the receive buffer is over 3/4 full. It is terminated
by one of two things:  1) The Link detects that the receive buffer
is less than 1/4 full. 2) The user application issues a Set Port
Parameters command with xonxoff disabled. (The latter is an
addition to the original driver specification.)

Outgoing characters - are taken from a set of pointers to buflet
chains and corresponding lengths. There is also a corresponding
flag, which is used in packet mode to determine if the buflet chain
should be freed when it is finished transmitting. As the lead
buflet list becomes empty, the pointers are shifted up and the last
pointer (and flag) is set to the original first pointer (and flag),
with the length set to zero. When all buffer lengths are 0, the
transmitter stops and must be restarted again by Link by calling
enable_xmt(). The Link level is responsible for setting these
pointers, lengths, and flags, with interrupts OFF. In character
mode, it will free each buflet chain when it reuses it's slot. In
packet mode, it will only free a buflet chain when it reuses the
slot AND the flag is set to TRUE. Also see XMTBUF.DAT.

Modem status - will be read into a storage location. It is Link's
job to check this and act based upon them.

Breaks and async errors - will be duly noted and counted. Action
taken by these is the responsibility of the Link level.

Timer interrupt processing:

The IBM PC and compatible machines have two timer interrupt vectors
for their basic timers. These are vector 0x1C, and vector 0x8.
Vector 0x8 is the interrupt vector called by the hardware when the
timer circuitry decides to issue a clock tick (18.2 times per
second). This vector normally enters the ROM BIOS and does basic
clock handling, after which the BIOS issues the user timer vector,
0x1C.

Because many programs make use of the 0x1C timer vector without
properly chaining to whichever vector was previously using it, the
current X.PC driver uses the 0x8 vector for it's timer interrupt
handling. This is different from earlier versions of the driver,
and could potentially cause conflicts with comm programs which
change this vector after a device reset (they should not be doing Šthis). We have added a parameter (-T) which will initialize the
vector at load time instead of at Device Reset time, which should
allow the driver to work with any program which chains on the 0x8
vector.


Interrupt processing proceedure:

Upon starting an interrupt, timer1_int() is called, with
a stack looking like this:  (All stacks are shown bottom to top)

  Flags (from interrupt)
  Return address (from interrupt)


timer1_int(), assuming X.PC timers are active, jumps to the
old INT 0x8 vector leaving the stack looking like this:

  Flags (from interrupt)
  Return address (from interrupt)
  Flags
  Address of timer2_int()


The old 0x8 routine does whatever it needs to do, this includes
doing the 8259 EOI after calling 0x1C routine. (This is a feature
of the IBM BIOS and compatibles.) When finished, it does an IRET
that goes to our timer2_int() routine because of the stack
manipulation in timer1_int(). The stack is left as it was upon the
start of the interrupt:

  Flags (from interrupt)
  Return address (from interrupt)


timer2_int() pushes all the registers on the stack and calls
dec_sixths(). If it was doing link processing already (a definate
possibility) it simply gets the registers off the stack and
returns. Otherwise, it saves the stack pointer and changes it to a
local stack area reserved for X.PC timer and link processing. Then
it enables interrupts and calls do_timers() followed by do_link().
When they are finished, it restores the stack pointers, the
registers, and returns.
