XPCANS2.DAT-April 28, 1987

This is a continuation of XPCANS.DAT:

122A. Concerning Red Ball/Green Ball logic. In our modified
version of the state table for Tymnet Echo Mode, there is an entry
for No Activity Timeout while in T3 state (Red Ball Out). This
entry requires the sending of a Green Ball and a change to T2
state. In both the older state tables and the description of these
modes in the PAD specification, it implies that while a Red Ball is
out, Green Balls should not be sent, only more Red Balls. The
latter case is consistant with the actual activity observed in the
3.03 version of the driver, and appears to perform the desired
function much better, so we have modified our driver and the state
tables to conform to the original specification. In fact, we can
see no reason for the change.

 TYMNET's Consat changes state from T3 to T2 after a short
 inactivity timeout and sends a green ball. The additional logic
 is an attempt to recover from losing a red ball.

 The X.PC PAD is modeled after the Consat. In this case, the
 evidence shows that deleting this logic does not interfere with
 the echo process. Coupled with eliminating the overhead
 incurred in trying to recover from a lost red ball, which is an
 unlikely event anyway, I agree that the transition is
 unnecessary.


123. We are adding a -T option that will chain on the 0x8 timer
interrupt at load time rather than at device reset. This is
necessary for applications that modify the interrupt after device
reset.

 This is ok.

124) There is some confusion on the proceedure which should be
followed at loss of carrier in various modes.

In character mode, we either set channel zero to call cleared
with the Modem Status Lost clear code, or we do nothing in
particular. In any case, input and output of data should be
unaffected. (In 4.00C we changed the code to return the call
cleared code for compatability with Smartym 3270.)

In packet mode, it appears that the proper proceedure is to clear
all connected channels, probably with the Packet Level Reset code,
and to set channel zero to call cleared with the Modem Status Lost
code. The driver should remain in packet mode. An inconsistancy
here is the fact that the Certification document seems to assume
that the driver automatically drops into character mode. This is
not true currently, and is not desirable in any case, as the
application will still be trying to read channel status, and if
dropped into character mode, will get errors instead. (It should be
the application's responsiblity to switch to character mode so it
can ignore CD. Shared modem pools, digital PBXs and LAN serial
servers frequently do not handle the handshaking signal correctly.)

 In character mode, set channel 0 status to Modem Status Lost
 clear code.

 In packet mode, clear all connected channels with the Packet
 Level Reset code and set channel 0 status to Modem Status Lost
 clear code.

 The certification procedure will be run expecting that the
 driver in packet mode does not automatically change to
 character mode when CD is lost.

125) There is a question on the use of the Parity PAD parameter.
Documentation suggests it has no effect other than to strip off the
Most Significant Bit of all echoed bytes. There is no effect on
data incoming from the host or outgoing to the host. Only echoed
bytes are effected. Is this true?

 The PAD Parity parameter only strips the most significant bit
 of echoed bytes. There is no effect on data sent or received
 between the PAD and the host.

126) In our state diagrams for Tymnet Echo control, there is an
error. It lists a change of state (And transmission of a Green
Ball) to T2 (Green Ball Out) when the No Activity Timer times out
in T3 (Red Ball Out) state. Since the documentation implies (And
the existing driver confirms...) that a Green Ball is not sent
while a Red Ball is out, it follows that this state change is not
possible. The original state diagram (June 13, 1986) is correct
for this case.

 The state diagram is correct for the Consat. See response to
 122A.

127) Ed Mooring has requested that the driver send a Restart
Request packet with a Cause Code of 0xF1 upon changing from Packet
mode to Character mode via a Set Character Mode function call.
Although otherwise undocumented, he says that this informs the XNS
to return to the "please log in:" prompt instead of waiting for the
next Session Request in character mode.

 This is ok.

128) The 3.0x drivers all set DTR and RTS upon Device Reset,
although the spec does not mention this. We have modified our
driver (ver 4.00B) to conform to this and downloaded it to Cathy
Chen so that she can continue testing without further problems
along these lines.

 Follow the example of 3.0x in setting DTR and RTS upon Device
 Reset.

Below is a summary of problems/solutions/changes to specifications çämade during X.PC 4.00 driver certification:

* Cathy Chen reported to us a problem with dialing using Tymcomm. çäThis turned out to be an undocumented feature of the old driver, çänamely that it would set DTR and RTS upon Device Reset with a non-çäzero port address. (128)

* Carrier Detect handling is changed so that it wil clear channel 0 çäwith clearing code 14 (Modem Status Lost) upon loss of Carrier, but çäwith no other action taken. This is the same in character and çäpacket mode.

* The PAD Parity parameter only strips the most significant bit of çäechoed bytes. There is no effect on data sent or received between çäthe PAD and the host. (76,125)

* The following changes to the driver specifications and driver çäcode were made:

- The driver is sending a Restart Request packet with a Diagnostic çäCode of 0xF1 upon changing from Packet mode to Character mode via a çäSet Character Mode function call. This causes the XNS to generate çäthe "please log in:" prompt instead of waiting for the next Session çäRequest. (114,127)

- The 1/6th of a second default character forwarding timeout has çäbeen changed to 1/3rd of a second. (8)

- Upon receipt of a reset, the channel is cleared with a call çäclearing code of reset received. (9,21,38,56,59,60,68)

- The reset diagnostic codes for packets out of window are now  1 çäfor invalid P(S) and 2 for invalid P(R). (75)

- 0x7D (}), 0x7E(~) and 0x7F(del) now lead to EDM. (80)

- Restarts issued with no diagnostic code are given a diagnostic çäcode of 0. (88) Version 4.00E.

* The restart timeout when switching to packet mode has been çächanged from 180 secs. to 15 secs. Two call clearing codes 12 and çä13 with necessary timers recently documented by Ed Mooring were çäadded.
