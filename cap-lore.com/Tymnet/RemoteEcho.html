<title>Remote Echoing</title>
<h3>Remote Echoing</h3>
This software statistical multiplexing was deployed from Palo Alto to Los Angeles.
Very quickly it became apparent that the variable echo delays were very disturbing since the sound of the Teletype’s printer was the visceral signal that one had indeed pressed a key.
While people were delighted that the most transmission errors had been eliminated, they found it difficult to type accurately.
<p>We had anticipated that this might be a problem and already had a plan.
The plan was difficult enough that we had not coded it before first deployment.
We went all-out to code <b>remote echoing</b>.
<p>The plan was to usually echo characters at the node (multiplexor) nearest the Teletype.
The 940 system was prone to situations where the echoed character came from the application program and not the operating system—the application could request that characters not be echoed.
The logical way of handling all of this is for the operating system to cease echoing characters until the application has had a chance to say “don’t echo” in response to the characters that have arrived but it has not had a chance to interpret.
With this plan, however, people found it disconcerting that echoes would cease after each line when they already knew that more input would be read by the application.
In these common situations the user would already type the next input, and want it to be immediately echoed.
If one wanted echoing to be properly inhibited, he would have to wait until the application had reached the point of canceling OS generated echoes.
The additional latency exacerbated this problem!
