<title>Terminology</title>
By ‘circuit switched’, <a href=http://rogerdmoore.ca/PS/EvolRobD.html>Larry Roberts</a> means maximum bandwidth allocated for entire session upon ‘call setup’.
That is what telco’s do until <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP>VoIP</a> which is only now (2016) becoming somewhat common.
Tymnet uses circuits but allocates bandwidth along such a circuit only as data arrives at each link.
Both techniques fall under ‘statistical multiplexing’ of intermediate links.
